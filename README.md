<strong><h1>Sessionz: Your Study App</h1></strong> <br>

<strong>Project description:</strong> <br>

This is a side and hackathon project I work on along 3 colleagues, Jonathan Navarrete, Carlos Ramirez and
Emmanuel Correa. We received the "Best Pebble Hack" prize in the Include-A-Thon, a hackathon hosted
by the association, Include Girls, in San Juan, Puerto Rico on October 4th 2015.<br> Here are some pictures of the activity and screenshots on how the app works.

<strong>My Role in the project</strong>
First, I started  designing the idea from scratch. Then, alongside Jonathan Navarrete, I worked on the front-end of the web-application. I worked on designing, implementing the User Interface of the application. For this, we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this part. Also, we used the framework, MeteorJS in the development of the application.

While our other teammates, Carlos Ramirez and Emmanuel Correa worked on designing and implementing the Pebble smartwatch application.

 Alongside the development of the application, I was the presenter of the project to the judges.
