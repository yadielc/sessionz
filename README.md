<strong><h1>Sessionz: Your Study App</h1></strong> <br>

<strong>Project description:</strong> <br>

This is a side and hackathon project I worked on alongside 3 colleagues, Jonathan Navarrete, Carlos Ramirez and
Emmanuel Correa. We received the "Best Pebble Hack" prize in the Include-A-Thon, a hackathon hosted
by the association, Include Girls, in San Juan, Puerto Rico on October 4th 2015.

<strong>What problem does this application solve?</strong> <br>

Time management and excellent study habits are the keys to the academic success of any student. However, many students, myself included, face the never-ending problem of procrastination and organizing ourselves. So, this app aims to solve this problem. By giving students the ability to take their study tasks on their wrists, the students can remember to study for their courses and actually get to it. 

<strong>How does this application work?</strong><br>

The application is divided into 2 components. A web application and a Pebble smartwatch application. The student enters the class he/she wants to study and schedules the time on his/her study time calendar.

Then, the web-application sends the data to the smartwatch application and the smartwatch stores the request. Next, the student can search for the course he/she wants to study for and run the timer.


<strong>My Role in the project</strong><br>

 In the planning stage of the project, I

My role was of a front-end developer in this case, of the web-application. I worked on designing, implementing the User Interface of the application, alongside Jonathan Navarrete. Among the development tools we used on the web application include, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this part. Also, we used the framework, MeteorJS in the development of the application.

While our other teammates, Carlos Ramirez and Emmanuel Correa worked on designing and implementing the Pebble smartwatch application. Which did an excellent job as well. Thanks to the hardwork we put in as a team, we won the prize. It was a pleasure working with such talented individuals.

 Alongside participating in the development of the application, I was the presenter of the project to the judges.<br><br>
