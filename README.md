<strong><h1>Sessionz: Your Study App</h1></strong> <br>

<strong>Project description:</strong> <br>

This is a side and hackathon project I work on along 3 colleagues, Jonathan Navarrete, Carlos Ramirez and
Emmanuel Correa. We received the "Best Pebble Hack" prize in the Include-A-Thon, a hackathon hosted
by the association, Include Girls, in San Juan, Puerto Rico on October 4th 2015.<br> Here are some pictures of the activity and screenshots on how the app works.
